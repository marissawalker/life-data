# Life Data
This project contains notebooks to analyze data from various apps tracking different aspects of my life. I will be using data from the following apps:

- Daylio: A daily mood and activity tracker that I have used consistently since 2019
- Google Location History: Location history downloaded from Google going back to 2014
- Strava: An app that I have used to track my walking activity since 2022

And I may add further apps later!
